The update can modify the state argument and the new state is the output of the operator.

The function signature of the update function is
```c++
void update(const in-type&, state-type&)

## Miscellaneous

* [Iterate](operators.md#iterate) Generates a stream of values from a generator (e.g. `Range`).  The values are generated one every `millis` milliseconds.  If `repeat` is true then the iterater will start over with the 1st value after it reaches the last.  The millis and repeat parameters are optional with defaults 0 and false respectively.
* [Poll](operators.md#poll) Generates a stream of values from an input by polling the current value every `millis` milliseconds.
* [Build](operators.md#build) This operator replaces the scan -> filter -> map pattern with a single operator and also only allocates one result object at creation time.  The operator keeps a state of `state-type` which is initially `init`.  For each input item, the given `function` is called with the input item and the current state and result as reference arguments.  If the function returns true, the current value of result is output otherwise nothing is output.

# Classes

## Generators

Classes that generated data on demand (e.g. via Iterate)

* [Range](classes.md#range) Generates integers in the range `from` to `to` by `increment`.  The increment is optional and defaults to 1.  Combine with `Iterate` to generate a stream.

## Producers

Classes that produce a stream of data

* [Interval](classes.md#interval) Produces integers from 0 on every `millis` milliseconds.
* [Repeat](classes.md#repeat) Produces `value` every cycle.

## Inputs

Classes that receive or sample input data

* [AnalogIn](classes.md#analogin) Reads analog values from an ADC `pin`.
* [BitIn](classes.md#bitin) Reads values from a digital `pin`.
* [GpioSerial](classes.md#gpioserial) Reads serial input from `rxPin` and outputs char values.  A `txPin` is required, and will be put in output mode, but is never set.

## Outputs

Classes that send or output data

* [AnalogOut](classes.md#analogout) Writes values to a PWM `pin`.
* [BitOut](classes.md#bitout) Writes values to a digital `pin`.
* [Console](classes.md#console) *C++:* Writes value to the serial output at the given `baud`.  *Javascript:* Writes value to the console.
* [HttpPost](classes.md#httppost) Sends data to an HTTP endpoint using the HTTP POST method using transport (e.g. an instance of WiFiClient).  Optional headers are provided as n array of strings.
* [MqttPub](classes.md#mqttpub) Publishs data to an MQTT endpoint with QOS 0.  The username, password, and keepAlive parameters are optional.
* [SocketIO](classes.md#socketio) Sends data to a WebSocket via the socket.io module `io` with the event name `event`.

## Consumers

* [Consume](classes.md#consume) Calls the function for each input value with that value as an argument.

# Methods

## Configuration

Functions for device/system configuration.

* [ConnectWifi](methods.md#connectwifi) Connect to a WiFi access point with the given `ssid` and `password`.
* [NetworkTime](methods.md#networktime) Set the date/time using an Internet time server with the given `transport` (e.g. a `WiFiClient`)
* [Sleepy](methods.md#sleepy) The `Sleepy` function enables automatic sleep management on
both AVR and Atmel SAMD (ARM) devices.  When sleep
management is enabled, the scheduler will attempt to put the
CPU in sleep/standby mode whenever there is 2 seconds or
more before the next scheduled event.  Tests on both
architectures showed slightly over 2mA current draw while
sleeping, which is probably a 1/10th or less of your awake
mode usage.

The sleep manager uses the RTC on SAMD architectures and the
WDT on AVR.  `Sleepy` can be called from the beginning or
end of the `app` function to enable sleep management.  If
you set the RTC time during setup, you must do that before
calling `Sleepy`.

The resolution of both the RTC and WDT is 1 second.  Using
even second values in your program schedule will minimize
the amount of time the CPU will be idle between the time it
wakes and the next event happens.

**USB Interaction** - The USB interface tends to interfere
with applications using sleep mode, and it is disabled by
default when you enable sleep management.  I recommend using
the SPI interface for output when using sleep mode.  If you
must use the USB you can call `Sleepy` with the
`SLEEP_MGR_USB` argument to enable the management of the
USB.  In this case, the USB will be detached before sleeping
and reattached upon wake up.
